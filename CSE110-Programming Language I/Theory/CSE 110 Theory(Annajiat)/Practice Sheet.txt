Day 1: Monday, November 10
Question 1 to 5

Day 2: Wednesday, November 12
Question 6 to 7


Question 1) Assume all first semester students have 4 courses: CSE110, ENG091, MAT110, PHY111.
Credits for these courses are 3, 0, 3, 3 respectively. 
Take the grades of four courses from the user (out of 4.0 scale) and then print the GPA

Formula:
GPA 
= summation of (multiplication of grade and credit of each course) divided by sum of credits
= (grade1xcredit1 + grade2xcredit2 + grade3xcredit3 ....) / (credit1 + credit 2+credit 3   ....)



Question 2) Ask user for mark, currentScale, targetScale and then convert the mark from currentScale to targetScale. 
If user gives 5, 10, 30, that means quiz mark 5 is out of 10 (currentScale), convert it to 30 and print 15.



Question 3) Assume there are two variables a and b. Take Values of these variables from the user.
For example, user gave following two values.
a = 721
b = 463
Then exchange / swap values in such a way so that
printing the variable a gives 463 and b gives 721.
Sample Input
721
463
Sample output:
Before Exchange:
a = 721
b = 463
After Exchange:
a = 463
b = 721


Question 4) 
Take value of a, b, c from the user. Then print in such a way that
value of a goes to b
value of b goes to c
value of c goes to a.
Input and output will be similar to Question 3.
It is the same problem as supplementary problem 2.1.2 in page 47 of How to solve it by computer.

Question 5) 
Take value of a, b, c, d from the user. Then print in such a way that
value of d goes to c
value of c goes to b
value of b goes to a
value of a goes to d.
Input and output will be similar to Question 3.
It is the same problem as supplementary problem 2.1.3 in page 47 of How to solve it by computer.



Question 6) Take a number from user and print its absolute value. If user gives minus five, print positive five. If user gives positive five, print positive five. No need to print plus sign.




Question 7)
Take hour from the user as input and tell it is time for which meal.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to
mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are
invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input.

Inputs : Message to be printed
4 to 6: Breakfast
12 to 13: Lunch
16 to 17: Snacks
19 to 20: Dinner
For all other valid inputs, say "Patience is a virtue"
For all other invalid inputs, say "Wrong time"


For example,
If the user enters 4, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 5, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 6, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 0, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 1, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 18, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 23, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 24, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters -1, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters 27, your program should print the message "Wrong time".
