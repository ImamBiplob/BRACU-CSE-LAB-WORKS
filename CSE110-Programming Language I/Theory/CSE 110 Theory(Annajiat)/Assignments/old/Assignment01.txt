Submission instructions:
===================
1. Submit on plain paper. Staple before coming into the class. You can staple from UB50401.
2. Write date of submission, name, ID, section, course, assignment number
3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc. Write in upper right corner of the first page of solutions.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart with your assignment paper.
7. You are not allowed to use && and || in your flowchart for this assignment.
You are not allowed to use  && || before midterm.
In midterm and after midterm, you may use && and II.


Solution Style Guideline:
=========================
1. Your flowchart should use proper variable names.
2. Do not forget to prompt before you take input in flowchart.
3. Do not overwrite, you may strikethrough and write at side.
4. For flowchart, use connector/junction as necessary. All boxes will
have one inward arrow and one outward arrow. The decision box can have
one inward arrow and two outward arrows. The connector/junction will
have maximum 3 inward arrows and only one outward arrow.
5. Test your flowchart as well by going from start to end for many
different inputs like what we do for trace tables. Trace Table is a
table with variable names and output as columns. We record value
changes for all variables as well as output in that table.
I will show usage of trace tables in class. Examples are available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_table
 and  at
http://goo.gl/VCUz8B

Inclusion of tracetable in your solution paper is optional and no marks
will be deducted if the table is not shown. However, you should use
tracetable to check for correctness.
6. If you do not understand the question, please click reply and ask
for clarification.
7. Use only one condition inside a decision box. For example, you can NOT write "
6>= hour >=4"
8. Try to complete this assignment with minimum number of decision
boxes. You can use
as many decision boxes you need. But you should use minimum number of
decision boxes that results in a correct solution. A correct solution
means, it gives correct output for all inputs.
9. You can add another page if you cannot finish in one page.  In
class, you were shown how to connect flowcharts across multiple pages
or different parts on the same page.
It is simple. It is called "on page connector" which is a small circle
and inside that, there will be a label to identify the connector.
Illustrated example is available at
http://www.flowhelp.com/flowchart/flowchart_connector_detail.html

Do NOT use the "off page connector".
