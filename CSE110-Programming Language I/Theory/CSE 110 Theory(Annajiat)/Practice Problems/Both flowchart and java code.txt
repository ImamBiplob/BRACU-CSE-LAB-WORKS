Both flowchart and java code (both while-loop and for-loop version)
1) Take n from user, print times table (namta) of n. If user gives 7, print
7x1=7
7x2=14
...
7x10=70
2) Take from & to from user, solve q1 for all numbers in between. If user give 5,8 print
5x1=5
5x2=10
....
8x10=80
3) Repeat q2 but ask user value of linesPerTable as well. If user give 8,9,3,print
8x1=8
8x2=16
8x3=24
9x1=9
9x2=18
9x3=27
