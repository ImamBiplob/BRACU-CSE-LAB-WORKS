ST will check however might not be able to return assignments, hence preserve a photocopy for your future reference or to revise later.

Solution Guideline:
===================
Write java code. Use for-loops for java programs if loop is necessary.

For each task, you may assume following lines are already written for you.
So, you do not have to repeat these lines for each task.

import static java.lang.System.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Task01 {
     public static void main (String[] args) {
           Scanner k = new Scanner (in);
            
           // your writing starts here

           // your writing ends here, so don't include following two closing curly braces in your solution

     }
}

Submission instructions:
===================
1. Submit on plain paper. Staple before coming into the class. You can staple from DCOs room.
2. Write date of submission, name, ID, section, course, assignment number
3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc. Write in upper right corner.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart with your assignment paper.
7. You are allowed to use && and ||.


Assignment03 Question:
===================
Both draw flowchart and write javacodes for all of the following problems.

Readings for Tasks 1 to 6:
Chapter 4 (4.1->4.6) and 5 (5.2->5.4) of How to Solve it by Computer.

Task1) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find the largest number and print it along with its location.
Output:
Largest number is 50
Largest number was found at location 3


Task2) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};

Modify Task2. Swap the first number with largest number.
Your output should be 50, 30, 20, 10, 40

Hint:
Find largestNumber and largestNumberLocation.
backup = a[0];
a[0]=largestNumber;
a[largestNumberLocation]=backup;


Task3) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {50, 30, 20, 10, 40};
Modify Task2.

Find largest number among all numbers between 2nd and 
last number (30, 20, 10, 40).
Swap the 2nd number with this largest number. 
Thus you just put 2nd largest in 2nd position.

Task4) Combine ideas from Task 2 and 3. 
Ask the user for a number n, and then find nth highest number 

Hint: 
Repeat the idea (from task 2,3) n times. 
Then you will find nth highest number in nth position in array.

Task 5) Modify Task 4 to sort / arrange all numbers in the array.
Your output should be 50, 40, 30, 20, 10

Hint:

Task 6) Find median among some numbers. 
Ask user how many numbers and input those numbers.

Definition of Median:
For example, if a < b < c, then the median of the list {a, b, c} is b, 
and, if a < b < c < d, then the median
 of the list {a, b, c, d} is the mean of b and c; 
i.e., it is (b + c)/2.

Hint:
Sort numbers
if there are odd number of numbers, say 9, then 
the median is the middle number, at 5th position

if there are even number of numbers, say 10, then 
the median is average of two middle numbers, (5th+6th)/2

Sample Input 1:
5
10 50 40 20 30
Sample Output 1:
30
Sample Input 2:
6
10 50 40 20 30 60
Sample Output 2:
35


You are NOT allowed to use array for Task 7 to 11.

Task7) Ask user for quantity and name. Then print name that many times.



Task8) Take n numbers from user and tell how many were odd and even.


Task9) Keep taking numbers from the user until the user gives -1, then print the average.


Task10) Solve task 9 with only one READ/INPUT/nextInt() in whole program.

Task11) Ask user the value of x and then calculate the value of sin(x). You are NOT allowed to use Math.sin() or any other Math functions/methods.
Hint:
Read Chapter 2 of How to Solve it by Computer
Specially, 
Algorithm 2.4: Factorial Computation
Algorithm 2.5: Sine Function Computation
