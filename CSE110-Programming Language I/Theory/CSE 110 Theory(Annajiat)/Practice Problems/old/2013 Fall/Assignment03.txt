Assignment03 Questions (multiple questions):
===================
Draw flowchart and write javacode for all of the following problems.

Question 1)
Minimum 4 variations of the flowchart for the following problem. Start with the solutions shown in class.

Take hour from the user as input and tell the time in 12-hour clock.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input. There is no minute/second in this clock. Consider only hours.

Sample Input / Output:
Please see "Clock.xlsx" file 


Question 2) Assume all first semester students have 4 courses: CSE110, ENG091, MAT110, PHY111.
Credits for these courses are 3, 0, 3, 3 respectively. 
Take the grades from the user for each of the courses (out of 4.0 scale) and then print the GPA

Formula:
GPA 
= summation of (multiplication of grade and credit of each course) divided by sum of credits
= (grade1xcredit1 + grade2xcredit2 + grade3xcredit3 ....) / (credit1 + credit 2+credit 3   ....)


Question 3) Ask the user for a number and print times table times table for that number. For example, if the user enters 3, then the output should be:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30

Question 4) Ask the user for first value, change and last value of an arithmetic series and then print the series.
If the user gives 10, 20, 134, then your program should print 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130.
If user gives 0, 100, 1234, then output should be 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200.

Question 5) Ask the user for a year and the number of times to print that year. If the user gives 2014 and 5, then the output should be,
2014
2014
2014
2014
2014
