submissions.

Regular Submission Date:
Wednesday, October 23, in class to TA.

Late Submission Date (50% mark will be deducted):
Monday, October 28 to TA. . Find TA at your own responsibility  for
late submissions.

TA will check and return assignments just like quizzes.

Submission instructions:
===================
1. Submit on plain paper. Staple before coming into the class. You can
staple from DCOs room.
2. Write, name, ID, section, course, assignment number
3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart
with your assignment paper.
7. You cannot use && and II in your flowchart for this assignment.

Solution Style Guideline:
===================
1. Your flowchart should use, proper variable names
2. Do not forget to prompt before you take input in flowchart
3. Do not overwrite, you may strikethrough and write at side.
4. For flowchart, use connector/junction as necessary. All boxes will
have one inward arrow and one outward arrow. The decision box can have
one inward arrow and two outward arrow. The connector/junction will
have maximum 3 inward arrow and only one outward arrow.
5. Test your flowchart as well by going from start to end for many
different inputs like what do we for trace table. Trace Table is a
table with variable names and output as a columns. We record value
changes for all variables as well as output in that table.
I will show usage of trace tables in class. Examples are available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_table
 and  at
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Problem_Solving,_Programming,_Data_Representation_and_Practical_Exercise/Problem_Solving/Trace_tables

Inclusion of tracetable in your solution paper is option and no marks
will be deducted if the table is not shown. However, you should use
tracetable to check for correctness.
6. If you do not understand the question,  please click reply and ask
for clarification.
7. Use only one condition inside a decision box. you can NOT write "
6>= hour >=4"
8. Try to complete this assignment with minimum number of decision
boxes. I think you will need at least 10 decision boxes. You can use
as many decision boxes you need. But you should use minimum number of
decision boxes that results in a correct solution. A correct solution
means, it gives correct output for all inputs.
9. You can add another page if you cannot finish in one page.  In
class, you were shown how to connect flowcharts across multiple pages
or different parts on the same page.
It is simple. It is called "on page connector" which is a small circle
and inside that, there will be a label to identify the connector.
Illustrated example is available at
http://www.flowhelp.com/flowchart/flowchart_connector_detail.html
Do NOT use the "off page connector".


Assignment01 Question:
===================
Draw flowchart for the following problem.

Take hour from the user as input and tell it is time for which meal.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to
mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are
invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input.

Inputs : Message to be printed
4 to 6: Breakfast
12 to 13: Lunch
16 to 17: Snacks
19 to 20: Dinner
For all other valid inputs, say "Patience is a virtue"
For all other invalid inputs, say "Wrong time"


For example,
If the user enters 4, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 5, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 6, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 0, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 1, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 18, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 23, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 24, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters -1, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters 27, your program should print the message "Wrong time".
