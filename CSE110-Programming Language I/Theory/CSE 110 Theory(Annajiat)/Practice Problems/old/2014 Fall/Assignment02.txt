3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc. Write in upper right corner.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart with your assignment paper.
7. You are allowed to use && and ||.


Assignment02 Question:
===================
Draw flowchart for all of the following problems

Task1a) For 5 numbers, find Maximum.
Task1b) For 5 numbers, find minimum.
Task1c) For 5 numbers, find average.

Task2) combine Task1a and Task1b into 1 flowchart. Hint: 
write same steps from both flowchart only once. If any line 
or any condition (along with yes/no part) is different, then 
write the different parts one after another.

Task3) combine flowcharts of Task2 and Task1c into 1 flowchart.

Task4) Add all numbers that are multiples of both 7 and 9 up to 600.

Task5) Add all numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 up to 600. 
Ensure that numbers like 63 are added only once in the sum.

Task6) Add all numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 but not both, up to 600.


Task7) Take a number and tells how many digits are in that number. 
Example: if user gives 9876, you should print 4.
Hint: keep dividing by ten and count how many times the 
could  be divided.
9876 by 10, is 987, count that got 1 digit
987 by 10, is 98, count that got 1 digit (total 2)
98 by 10, is 9, count that got 1 digit (total 3)
9 by 10, is 0, count that got 1 digit (total 4)
done!


Task8) Take a number and prints the value of 10 to the power that number.
You need to use loop because variable in the power isn't allowed.
For example: if user gives 3, print 1000.
Hint: Keep multiplying 1 by 10, again and again, 3 (or n) times
like sum=sum+n, you need to write, product = product x 10
1 x 10 = 10
10 x 10 = 100
100 x 10 = 1000
1000 x 10 = 10000


Task9) Take a number and prints the digits from unit's place, then tenth, then hundredth, etc.
Example: if user gives 32768, then print 8, 6, 7, 2, 3
Hint: Taking remainder/modulus of division by 10. 
After printing the remainder, drop the last digit by 
dividing by 10. Then start over.

32,768 % 10 = 8
32,768 / 10 = 3, 276

3, 276 % 10 = 6
3, 276 / 10 = 327

327 % 10 = 7
327 / 10 = 32

32 % 10 = 2
32 / 10 = 3

3 % 10 = 3
3 / 10 = 0


Task10) Take a number and prints the digits from left to right.
Example: if user gives 32768, then print 3, 2, 7, 6, 8
Hint: count how many digits
calculate 10 to the power that (number of digits) minus 1. 
Say, 32768 has 5 digits, 
so you calculate 10 to the power 4 which is 10,000. 
Then divide 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 3.
take remainder of 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 2,768
Then divide 10,000 by 10 to get 1,000
Then divide 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 2.
take remainder of 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 768
keep going on until there is no more digits left (zero!).
In short:
Loop 1: First count digits, say 5 in this case for 32,768
Loop 2: Then calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10,000. 
Loop 3: Then repeat following three steps

32,768 / 10,000 = 3
32,768 % 10,000 = 2,768
10,000/10 = 1,000

2,768 / 1,000 = 2
2,768 % 1,000 = 768
1,000/10 = 100

768 / 100 = 7
768 % 100 = 68
100/10 = 10

68 / 10 = 6
68 % 10 = 8
10/10 = 1

8 / 1 = 8
8 % 1 = 0
1/10 = 0


Task11) Telling words: A program that takes a number between 0 and 9. 
You have to print that number in words.
Hint: if n == 1, then print "one"
else if n == 2, then print "two"

Task12) Combine Task 10 and 11 into a single flowchart 
program so that it can tell any number in words. 
Example: If user gives 932, print nine three two.

Task13) Take a number and prints all numbers up to that number.
If the user gives 8, print 1 to 8.

Task14) Take a number and counts how many times that number can be 
divided by all numbers up to that number (Those numbers are 
also known as factors)
If the user gives 8, tries to divide 8 by each of 1 to 8
and count how many times it could be divided.
For example: 
If user enters 8,
try to divide 8 by 1, its divisible (increase count to 1)
try to divide 8 by 2, its divisible (increase count to 2)
try to divide 8 by 3, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 4, its divisible (increase count to 3)
try to divide 8 by 5, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 6, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 7, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 8, its divisible (increase count to 4)
Now print the count which is 4 in this case.


Task15) If a number is NOT divisible any number other than 1
and itself, then it is called prime number. 
For example, 13 is a prime number because it is NOT
divisible by any number other than 1 and 13 (itself).
Take one number from the user and tell if it is prime number or not.
Hint: Use the technique from Task14 and count factors of the 
input. Factors are those numbers between 1 and n that can 
divide the number, n. If there are more than two factors (1 
and n), then the number, n is not prime because it was 
divisible by other numbers.


Task16) Modify Task15, instead of counting factors, 
print sum of factors.

Task17) Modify Task15, calculate sum of factors less than 
the number itself. If the sum equals to the number, then 
print that the number is a perfect number.
Example: User enters n = 6. Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3.
Sum of those factors 1+2+3=6 which is same as the number 6(n).
So, print that 6 is a perfect number.
Example2: If user enters 8. Factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4.
1+2+4=7 (NOT equal to 8).
So, print that 8 is NOT a perfect number.

Task18) Ask user for a range. Count how many numbers are prime number
and how many numbers are perfect numbers between that range.
For example, between 2 and 6 there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) 
and 1 perfect number (6).

Sample Input:
2 6
Sample Output:
Between 2 and 6,
Found 3 prime numbers
Found 1 perfect number.
