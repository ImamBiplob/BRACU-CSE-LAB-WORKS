import static java.lang.System.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Task01 {
     public static void main (String[] args) {
           Scanner k = new Scanner (in);
            
           // your writing starts here

           // your writing ends here, so don't include following two closing curly braces in your solution

     }
}
