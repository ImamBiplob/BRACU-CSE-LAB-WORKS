Non-graded Practice Assignment 1 for Annajiat's CSE110 Theory students

Submission dates are unlikely to be changed, so you should be ready to submit whenever the university opens and Student Tutor is available.

It will not be wise to wait for last/end dates/deadlines. 

There are 3 date / date ranges for submission. So, everyone gets 3 chances to submit assignment 
a) early 
b) regular 
c) late 

Read the dates carefully.

Early Submission Date Ranges:
Starts: Thursday, May 28
Ends: Sunday, June 7
Find and submit to Student Tutor (ST) at your own responsibility for early submissions. ST will be available during his/her consultation hours at UB40202. Assignment may be submitted there or any other time/place negotiated with ST.
You should be solving about 3 flowcharts per day to be able to submit within early submission dates.


Regular Submission Date:
Monday, June 8, in class to ST. 
On this day, You should submit whatever you have, no matter how many questions you were able to solve.


Late Submission Date Ranges:
Starts: Wednesday, June 10
Ends: Monday, June 15 to ST. 
Find ST at your own responsibility for late submissions.


ST will check and return assignments.

Submission instructions:
===================
1. Submit on plain paper. Staple before coming into the class. You can staple from DCOs room.
2. Write date of submission, name, ID, section, course, assignment number
3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc. Write in upper right corner of the first page of solutions.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart with your assignment paper.
7. You are not allowed to use && and || in your flowchart for this assignment.
You are not allowed to use  && || before midterm.
In midterm and after midterm, you may use && and II.


Solution Style Guideline:
=========================
1. Your flowchart should use proper variable names.
2. Do not forget to prompt before you take input in flowchart.
3. Do not overwrite, you may strikethrough and write at side.
4. For flowchart, use connector/junction as necessary. All boxes will
have one inward arrow and one outward arrow. The decision box can have
one inward arrow and two outward arrows. The connector/junction will
have maximum 3 inward arrows and only one outward arrow.
5. Test your flowchart as well by going from start to end for many
different inputs like what we do for trace tables. Trace Table is a
table with variable names and output as columns. We record value
changes for all variables as well as output in that table.
I will show usage of trace tables in class. Examples are available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_table
 and  at
http://goo.gl/VCUz8B

Inclusion of tracetable in your solution paper is optional and no marks
will be deducted if the table is not shown. However, you should use
tracetable to check for correctness.
6. If you do not understand the question, please click reply and ask
for clarification.
7. Use only one condition inside a decision box. you can NOT write "
6>= hour >=4"
8. Try to complete this assignment with minimum number of decision
boxes. I think you will need at least 10 decision boxes for Question 1. You can use
as many decision boxes you need. But you should use minimum number of
decision boxes that results in a correct solution. A correct solution
means, it gives correct output for all inputs.
9. You can add another page if you cannot finish in one page.  In
class, you were shown how to connect flowcharts across multiple pages
or different parts on the same page.
It is simple. It is called "on page connector" which is a small circle
and inside that, there will be a label to identify the connector.
Illustrated example is available at
http://www.flowhelp.com/flowchart/flowchart_connector_detail.html

Do NOT use the "off page connector".

10. Copying assignment questions is optional / not required.


Assignment01 Question:
===================
Draw flowchart for the following problems.
Questions 1 to 7 do not require loop.
Question 8 to last require loop.
Questions 3 to 5 and 12 to last requires reading the book. If you did not understand relevant text for particular problems, highlight using a pencil / highlight pen from your book and show ST/theory teacher the lines that you did not understand (in next class or scan / camerashot  as email attachment)


Question 1)
Take hour from the user as input and tell it is time for which meal.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to
mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are
invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input.

Inputs: Message to be printed
4 to 6: Breakfast
12 to 13: Lunch
16 to 17: Snacks
19 to 20: Dinner
For all other valid inputs, say "Patience is a virtue"
For all other invalid inputs, say "Wrong time"


For example,
If the user enters 4, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 5, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 6, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 0, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 1, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 18, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 23, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 24, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters -1, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters 27, your program should print the message "Wrong time".



Question 2) Assume all first semester students have 4 courses: CSE110, ENG091, MAT110, PHY111.
Credits for these courses are 3, 0, 3, and 3 respectively. 
Take the grades of four courses from the user (out of 4.0 scale) and then print the GPA

Formula:
GPA 
= summation of (multiplication of grade and credit of each course) divided by sum of credits
= (grade1xcredit1 + grade2xcredit2 + grade3xcredit3 ....) / (credit1 + credit 2+credit 3   ....)



Read Chapter 2 of How to solve it by Computer by R G Dromey for the following questions.

For question 3 to 5:
Read Chapter 2, Article 2.1
from: Page book: 42 (PDF: 63)
to: Page book: 47 (PDF: 68)


Question 3) Assume there are two variables a and b. Take Values of these variables from the user.
For example, user gave following two values.
a = 721
b = 463
Then exchange / swap values in such a way so that
printing the variable a gives 463 and b gives 721.
Sample Input
721
463
Sample output:
Before Exchange:
a = 721
b = 463
After Exchange:
a = 463
b = 721


Hint for question 3:
It it fine to swap  variables using a third/temporary variable or without it. Both approaches are allowed.
Read more on swapping variable at http://bit.ly/18MrSR2


Question 4) Solve supplementary problem 2.1.2 in page 47.
Take value of a, b, c from the user. Then print in such a way that
value of a goes to b
value of b goes to c
value of c goes to a.
Input and output will be similar to Question 3.

Question 5) Solve supplementary problem 2.1.3 in page 47.
Input and output will be similar to Question 3.

Question 6) Take a number from user and print its absolute value. If user gives minus five, print positive five. If user gives positive five, print positive five. No need to print plus sign.


Question 7) Ask user for mark, currentScale, targetScale and then convert the mark from currentScale to targetScale. If user gives 5, 10, 30, that means quiz mark 5 is out of 10 (currentScale), convert it to 30 and print 15.



Question 8) Ask the user for a year and the number of times to print that year. If the user gives 2014 and 5, then the output should be,
2014
2014
2014
2014
2014


Question 9) Ask the user for a number and print times table times table for that number. Ask the user up to which times to print. For example, if the user enters 3, 11, then the output should be:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
3 x 11 = 30


Question 10) Ask the user for first value, change and last value of an arithmetic series and then print the series.
Example 1:
If the user gives 10, 20, 134, then your program should print 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130.
Explanation for Example 1:
first value = 10
change = 20
last value = 134
The terms (pod) of the series increases by 20, stops at 130 because 140 would exceed 134.

Example 2:
If user gives 0, 100, 1234, then output should be 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200.

Question 11) Same as question 10 but solve it for geometric series. If user gives 2, 10, 20000, then output should be 2, 20, 200, 2000, 20000.





For questions 12 to 13:
Read Chapter 2, Article 2.2
from: Page book: 47 (PDF: 68)
to: Page book: 50 (PDF: 71)

Question 12) Ask user how many numbers and solve supplementary problem 2.2.2

Question 13) Ask user total number of students (n) and solve supplementary problem 2.2.3




For questions 14 to last:
Read Chapter 2, Article 2.3
from: Page book: 51 (PDF: 72)
to: Page book: 55 (PDF: 76)

The problems are listed in Page book: 56 (PDF: 77)

Question 14) Ask user how many numbers (n) and solve supplementary problem 2.3.1

Question 15) 2.3.2

Question 16) 2.3.3

Question 17) 2.3.4

Question 18) 2.3.5

Question 19) 2.3.6 (Be attentive to the part "without multiplication")

Question 20) 2.3.7 

Question 21) 2.3.8

Question 22) Ask the user how many courses, and re-implement your solution of Question 2 by using a loop. Take both credit and grade for each course from user as input.
