Solution Guideline:
===================
Write java code. Use for-loops for java programs if loop is necessary.
Use Scanner only if taking input is necessary.

For each task, you may assume following lines are already written for you.
So, you do not have to repeat these lines for each task.

import static java.lang.System.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Task01 {
     public static void main (String[] args) {
           Scanner k = new Scanner (in);
            
           // your writing starts here

           // your writing ends here, so don't include following two closing curly braces in your solution

     }
}
