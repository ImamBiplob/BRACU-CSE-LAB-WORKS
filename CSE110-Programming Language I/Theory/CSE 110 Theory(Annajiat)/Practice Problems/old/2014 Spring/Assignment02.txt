Assignment 2 for Annajiat’s CSE110 Thoery students

Early Submission Date for 20% bonus:
Thursday, March 20 to TA. Find TA at your own responsibility for early submissions.
Be aware that March 17, Monday is a national holiday, so you will not find TA on that day.

Regular Submission Date:
Monday, March 24, in class to TA.

Late Submission Date (50% mark will be deducted):
Thursday, March 27 to TA. Find TA at your own responsibility  for late submissions.
Be aware that March 26, Tuesday is a national holiday, so you will not find TA on that day.

TA will check and return assignments just like quizzes. Due to volume of this question, TA might not be able to return the scripts in time. Hence you are requested to consult beforehand with TA in person or online through email/chat and submit correct / verified solutions. Furthermore, retain a photocopy of what you have submitted so that you can practice for final exam for future quizzes. This extra copy can also be used to take further feedback from faculty members.


Submission instructions:
===================
1. Submit on plain paper. Staple before coming into the class. You can staple from DCOs room.
2. Write date of submission, name, ID, section, course, assignment number
3. Do NOT use an extra coversheet / front page for writing name, id etc. Write in upper right corner.
4. You can use pen or pencil or both.
5. Everything must be hand written / drawn. Printouts will not be accepted.
6. It is optional for you to include a trace table of your flowchart
with your assignment paper.
7. You are not allowed to use && and II in your flowchart for this assignment.
You are not allowed to use  && || before midterm.
In midterm and after midterm, you may use && and II.
8. Those who did not understand the question or need further help,
you can take help of the TA or you can ask in the group by clicking reply to this email (instead
of composing a new mail)

Solution Style Guideline:
=========================
1. Your flowchart should use, proper variable names
2. Do not forget to prompt before you take input in flowchart
3. Do not overwrite, you may strikethrough and write at side.
4. For flowchart, use connector/junction as necessary. All boxes will
have one inward arrow and one outward arrow. The decision box can have
one inward arrow and two outward arrow. The connector/junction will
have maximum 3 inward arrow and only one outward arrow.
5. Test your flowchart as well by going from start to end for many
different inputs like what do we for trace table. Trace Table is a
table with variable names and output as a columns. We record value
changes for all variables as well as output in that table.
I will show usage of trace tables in class. Examples are available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_table
 and  at
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Problem_Solving,_Programming,_Data_Representation_and_Practical_Exercise/Problem_Solving/Trace_tables

Inclusion of tracetable in your solution paper is option and no marks
will be deducted if the table is not shown. However, you should use
tracetable to check for correctness.
6. If you do not understand the question,  please click reply and ask
for clarification.
7. Use only one condition inside a decision box. you can NOT write "
6>= hour >=4"
8. Try to complete this assignment with minimum number of decision
boxes. I think you will need at least 10 decision boxes for Question 1. You can use
as many decision boxes you need. But you should use minimum number of
decision boxes that results in a correct solution. A correct solution
means, it gives correct output for all inputs.
9. You can add another page if you cannot finish in one page.  In
class, you were shown how to connect flowcharts across multiple pages
or different parts on the same page.
It is simple. It is called "on page connector" which is a small circle
and inside that, there will be a label to identify the connector.
Illustrated example is available at
http://www.flowhelp.com/flowchart/flowchart_connector_detail.html
Do NOT use the "off page connector".


10.
Submit handwritten assignments
for each Question, you may assume following lines are already written for you.
So, you do not have to repeat these lines for each question.

import static java.lang.System.*;
import java.util.*;
public class Question01 {
     public static void main (String[] args) {
           Scanner k = new Scanner (System.in);
            
           // your writing starts here

           // your writing ends here, so don't include following two closing curly braces in your solution

     }
}

11.
For java programs if loop is necessary,
use while-loop: for question 4, 5, 7, 13 to 15
use for-loop: for question 6, 8, 16 to 24

12.
Question 1 to 8: Java codes
Question 9 to last: Both flowchart and java code.




Assignment02 Question (multiple questions):
===================
Question 1)
Take hour from the user as input and tell it is time for which meal.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to
mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are
invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input.

Inputs : Message to be printed
4 to 6: Breakfast
12 to 13: Lunch
16 to 17: Snacks
19 to 20: Dinner
For all other valid inputs, say "Patience is a virtue"
For all other invalid inputs, say "Wrong time"


For example,
If the user enters 4, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 5, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 6, your program should print the message "Breakfast".
If the user enters 0, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 1, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 18, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 23, your program should print the message "Patience
is a virtue".
If the user enters 24, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters -1, your program should print the message "Wrong Time".
If the user enters 27, your program should print the message "Wrong time".



Question 2)
Take hour from the user as input and tell the time in 12-hour clock.
User will input the number in 24-hour format say 14 to mean 2pm, 3 to mean 3am, 18 to mean 6pm etc.
Valid inputs are 0 to 23. Inputs less than 0 or more than 23 are invalid in 24-hour clock.
Input will be whole numbers. For example, 3.5 will NOT be given as input. There is no minute/second in this clock. Consider only hours.
Only one variation is sufficient, you do not need to show four variations.

Sample Input / Output:
Please see "Clock.xlsx" file 


Question 3) Assume all first semester students have 4 courses: CSE110, ENG091, MAT110, PHY111.
Credits for these courses are 3, 0, 3, 3 respectively. 
Take the grades of four courses from the user (out of 4.0 scale) and then print the GPA

Formula:
GPA 
= summation of (multiplication of grade and credit of each course) divided by sum of credits
= (grade1xcredit1 + grade2xcredit2 + grade3xcredit3 ....) / (credit1 + credit 2+credit 3   ....)


Question 4) Ask the user for a year and the number of times to print that year. If the user gives 2014 and 5, then the output should be,
2014
2014
2014
2014
2014


Question 5) Ask the user for a number and print times table times table for that number. Ask the user upto what to print to. For example, if the user enters 3, 11, then the output should be:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
3 x 11 = 30


uestion 6) Ask the user for two numbers and print times table times table for all numbers between those two number. Ask the user upto what to print to. For example, if the user enters 3, 7, 11, then the output should be:
Times Table for 3:
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
......
3 x 10 = 30
3 x 11 = 33
Times Table for 4:
4 x 1 = 1
....
....
7 x 11 = 77

Question 7) Ask the user for first value, change and last value of an arithmetic series and then print the series.
If the user gives 10, 20, 134, then your program should print 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130.
If user gives 0, 100, 1234, then output should be 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200.

Question 8) Same as question 7 but solve it for geometric series.


For question 9 to 11:
Read Chapter 2, Article 2.1
from: Page book: 42 (PDF:63)
to: Page book: 47 (PDF:68)

Question 9) Assume there are two variables a and b. Take Values of these variables from the user.
For example, user gave following two values.
a = 721
b = 463
Then exchange / swap values in such a way so that
printing the variable a gives 463 and b gives 721.
Sample Input
721
463
Sample output:
Before Exchange:
a = 721
b = 463
After Exchange:
a = 463
b = 721


Question 10) Solve question 9 for three variables a, b, c.
That is supplementary problem 2.1.2 in page 47.
Take value of a, b, c from the user. Then print in such a way that
value of a goes to b
value of b goes to c
value of c goes to a.
Input and output will be similar to Question 9.

Question 11) Solve question 10 for four variables. That is supplementary problem 2.1.3 in page 47.

Question 12) Solve question 9 for two variables without using a third variable. That is supplementary problem 2.1.4 in page 47.

Question 13) Ask user how many numbers to be input. Then find the Maximum among those numbers.
Question 14) Ask user how many numbers to be input. Then find the Minimum among those numbers
Question 15) Ask user how many numbers to be input. Then find the average among those numbers
Question 16) combine flowcharts and javacodes of finding maximum and 
minimum from Question 13 into 1 flowchart and 1 javacode. Hint: 
write same steps from both flowchart only once. If any line 
or any condition (along with yes/no part) is different, then 
write the different parts one after another.

Question 17) combine flowcharts and javacodes of Question 15 and 16 with finding 
average into 1 flowchart and 1 javacode

Question 18) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of both 7 and 9 up to 600.

Question 19) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 up to 600. 
Ensure that numbers like 63 are added only once in the sum.

Question 20) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 but not both, up to 600.

Question 21) Ask user how many numbers there will be. Then find the first and last odd number given by the user. You may saefely asssume that user will give at least two odd numbers in the input.
Sample Input: 5  10  11  20  3  15 
Sample Output:
First Odd: 11, Last Odd: 15

Question 22) Solve question 21 again but assume there might not be odd numbers in the input. In case you could not find either odd numbers, print "None Found".
Sample Input A: 2  10  20
Sample Output B:
First Odd: None Found
Last Odd: None Found

Sample Input B: 3  10  20 7
Sample Output B:
First Odd: 7
Last Odd: None Found

Question 23) Ask user how many numbers to be input. Then find the largest negative odd number and smallest positive even number. You may saefely asssume that input will be such so that you can print these two outputs.
Sample Input: 9  -12  7  8  -13  10  -14  -15  9  100
Sample Output:
largest negative odd number: -13
smallest positive even number: 8

Question 24) Solve question 23 again but assume that you might not be able to find such one/two outputs. In those cases, print "None Found".
