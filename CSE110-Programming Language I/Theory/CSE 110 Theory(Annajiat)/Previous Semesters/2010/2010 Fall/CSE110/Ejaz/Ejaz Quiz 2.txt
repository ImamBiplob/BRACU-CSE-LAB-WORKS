Question 1
Consider the following code:
public class ArrayTraceC
{  
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    int [] myArray = new int[11];
    int [] myArray2 = myArray;
    int index1 = 0, index2 =0;
    index1 = 1;
    while (index1 < 11){
    myArray[index1] = index1 + 5;
    index2 = 1;
      while (index2 < index1 ){
        myArray[index1] = myArray[index1] + myArray2[index2] - index1;
        index2 = index2 + 1;
    }
    System.out.println(myArray[index1]);
    index1 = index1 + 1;
    }
  }
}
What is the output?







Question 2
Write a complete pseudo-code/flowchart of a program, which prints all Lucas numbers that are less than 1500.
The Lucas numbers are the sequence of integers defined by the linear equation

L(n)=L(n-1)+L(n-2) 	

with L(1)=1 and L(2)=3. 

The values of L(n) for n=1, 2, ... are 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123 ...
