From How to Solve it by Computer book,
read Chapter 4 (from 4.3 to end of ...)
from Page 152 (PDF: 173) to Page ... (PDF: ...)
and solve following problems in Java.

1)4.4.0  (The Algorithm on Page 154 [PDF 175])
2)4.4.1
3)4.4.2
4)4.5.0  (The Algorithm on Page 163 [PDF 184])
5)4.5.1
6)4.5.3

7)4.6.0  (The Algorithm on Page 171 [PDF 192]) 
8) Take n numbers from user and find Q1, Q2, Q3
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile

9) From an unsorted array, find the max quantity of consecutive/adjacent numbers that are strictly increasing

10) Take two unsorted array from user and print from merged array. That is create a third array and print from there.

11) Take two sorted array from user and print merged array. Merge is such a away that 3rd array becomes sorted without manual sorting.

12) Sort an array. Stop sorting when array is sorted. Use a boolean variable to check if changes are done in a loop. Stop as soon as no change is made in one iteration/pass of loop.

12) Take 5 numbers from user, no duplicates allowed.
13) Modify 12, only two copies allowed
14) Modify 13, only m (input) copies are allowed instead of 2.
15) Take 10 numbers. Sort only numbers at even indices/locations. Ignore odd locations. If user gives
5 200 3 100 9 400 4 3000 6 88
output should be
3 200 4 100 5 400 6 3000 9 88
