1) Design a MyComplex class with gettters/setters and print value (using toString) so that 3 + 5i is printed after executing following statements:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex();
a.setRealPart(3);
a.setImaginaryPart(5);
out.println(a);

2) Modify Task1 to allow printing negative imaginary part correctly, 3 - 5i (instead of 3 + -5i)

3) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex();
MyComplex b = new MyComplex();
a.setRealPart(3);
a.setImaginaryPart(5);
b.setRealPart(20);
b.setImaginaryPart(40);
MyComplex c = a.add(b);
out.println(c); //should print 23 + 45i

4) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex(3, 5);
out.println(a); //should print 3 + 5i

5) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex();
MyComplex b = new MyComplex(6);
MyComplex c = new MyComplex(20, 50);
out.println(a); //should print 0 + 0i
out.println(b); //should print 6 + 0i
out.println(c); //should print 20 + 50i

6) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex(3, 5);
MyComplex b = new MyComplex(20, 50);
MyComplex c = a.add(b);
out.println(c); //should print 23 + 45i

7) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex();
MyComplex b = new MyComplex(6);
MyComplex c = new MyComplex(20, 50);
MyComplex d = new MyComplex(100, 300);
MyComplex e = a.add(b).add(c).add(d);
out.println(e); //should print 126 + 350i

8) Design MyComplex class so that followings are possible:
MyComplex a = new MyComplex(20, 50);
MyComplex b = new MyComplex(a);
b.setRealPart(4);
out.println(b); //should print 4 + 50i

out.print(a);/*should print followings:
